# Welcome to Yam Space 🙌
A cozy, minimal space with no fancy desk setup—so you can stay focused and get your daily tasks done 🥲. This interactive 3D portfolio explores how modern web technologies can create immersive, high-performance experiences directly in the browser. Built with Three.js and React, the project focuses on smooth interaction, visual clarity, and meaningful user engagement.

Rather than presenting work in a static layout, this portfolio invites visitors to navigate a 3D environment, interact with objects, and explore content in a more natural and memorable way—mirroring how people engage with real spaces.
